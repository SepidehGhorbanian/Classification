Predicting whether the client would buy a car or not

Using the KNN algorithm from Classification algorithms (Supervised)

The code is in Python and it is using the Scikit-learn (Sklearn) library

Dataset: The 'Social_Network_Ads' dataset
The dataset has these features: User ID, Gender, Age, EstimatedSalary, Purchased
The 'Purchased' column is the lables and we put it in a 'y' variable
We make the predictions based on these two features: Age, EstimatedSalary

Algorithm: After preparing the dataset, we fit the KNN algorithm to the training dataset and then we can show the predicted labels for the testing dataset
Lastly, we can calculate the accuracy and then plot the confusion matrix for better understanding
