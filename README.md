# Social_Network_Ads_Classification


## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is implementing classification algorithms on the Social Network Ads dataset and calculating and comparing the accuracy of them.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Scaling
* Machine Learning (Classification algorithms)
* Predictive Modeling
* Performance Evaluation

### Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project Description
In machine learning, classification is a supervised learning and it refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.

The classification of social media ads is all about analyzing the ads for classifying whether your target audience will buy the product or not. Itâ€™s a great use case for data science in marketing.

Some of the best classification algorithms are KNN and Decision Trees. These algorithms have been implemented in this project on the same dataset and the accuracy of them has been calculated. The difference between them can be shown by comparing the results. Often the algorithm which has the best performance gets chosen for the purpose.

Confusion Matrix of the KNN algorithm is [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Classification/blob/main/KNN_SocialNetworkAds/Confusion%20Matrix_KNN.png).
Confusion Matrix of the Decision Tree is [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Classification/blob/main/KNN_SocialNetworkAds/Confusion%20Matrix_DecisionTree.png).
